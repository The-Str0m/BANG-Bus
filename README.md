# smartraveller.io

## overview

SmarTraveller.io is an integrated solution that helps users travel smarter in Bangalore using the public transit system (BMTC). Our tool includes a routing system that provides accurate estimates and travel methods using the BMTC system. It also provides common phrases in Kannada for easy communication, as well as commonly taken journeys. In addition to this, our tool includes a mapping system that shows all the buses and stations in the city. Using the buses' GPS data, we estimate the congestion in each individual bus, so the user can take a smart decision on what bus to take, instead of waiting for an empty bus that may never come.

## disclaimer

AI was used to assist in the creation of this project. For the routing system, AI was used in Styles CSS (almost 60% ai beacuse its very time consuming to type in colour codes and manually enter the values), theme manager to create scripts to allow for seamless theme changing, app JS to create the hover effect and hightlighting. AI was used in the mapping system to assist in the creation of the CORS headers, EMA smoothing of parameters, as well as fixing issues related to API access. It was also used to assist in the creation of smooth scrolling of buses, clarify syntax errors related to the Leaflet mapping platform, and general debugging.
The main LLMS used were ChatGPT.
